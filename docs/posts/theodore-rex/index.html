<p>Theodore had been a Tyrannosaurus for sixty-seven years, which was longer than most, and he had come to certain conclusions about existence that he suspected were not shared by his peers. For one thing, he had noticed that the sky had been wrong for three days now. Not wrong in the way it was wrong when rain came, or wrong in the way it was wrong at dusk. Wrong in a way that suggested the sky itself had made a decision.</p>
<p>“The sky has made a decision,” Theodore said to Margaret, who was a Triceratops and therefore unlikely to be eaten by him, which had formed the basis of their friendship.</p>
<p>“You’re always saying things like that,” Margaret said. She was eating a fern. She was always eating a fern. Theodore had never seen her not eating a fern, and he had begun to wonder if perhaps Margaret was less a dinosaur and more a elaborate fern-processing system that had somehow developed opinions.</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like the sky has made a decision. Or the river is thinking. Or that time you said the volcano was embarrassed.”</p>
<p>“The volcano was embarrassed. You could tell by the smoke.”</p>
<p>Margaret continued eating her fern.</p>
<p>The ash had been falling for two days. Theodore had tasted it on his tongue and found it distasteful. He had small arms, a fact he had made peace with decades ago, but it meant he could not wave the ash away from his face, and so he had to simply experience it, which struck him as a metaphor for something, though he could not say what.</p>
<p>“Do you ever think,” Theodore said, “that we are characters in a story being told by someone who has no idea what they’re doing?”</p>
<p>“No,” Margaret said.</p>
<p>“I think about it constantly.”</p>
<p>A smaller dinosaur ran past them screaming. Theodore did not recognize the species. There were so many species now. It had gotten out of hand, frankly. Every time he turned around there was a new dinosaur with a new name, some with feathers, some with plates, some with what appeared to be entirely too many teeth for any reasonable purpose.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Theodore called after the small dinosaur.</p>
<p>“Away from here!” the small dinosaur screamed back.</p>
<p>“That’s not a place,” Theodore said, but the small dinosaur was already gone.</p>
<p>He looked at the horizon, which was the color of a bruise, if bruises were also on fire. The ground had been shaking for hours in a way that suggested the ground, too, had made a decision, and that the decision was similar to the sky’s decision, and that neither decision was good news for Theodore or Margaret or the screaming dinosaur or anyone else who had grown accustomed to existing.</p>
<p>“I think this might be the end,” Theodore said.</p>
<p>“The end of what?”</p>
<p>“Of everything. All of it. The whole operation.”</p>
<p>Margaret stopped eating her fern, which was so unusual that Theodore felt a chill despite the oppressive heat.</p>
<p>“I had plans,” Margaret said.</p>
<p>“What plans?”</p>
<p>“I was going to eat that fern over there tomorrow.” She gestured with her horn toward a fern that looked identical to every other fern Theodore had ever seen. “It’s a good fern. I’ve been saving it.”</p>
<p>Theodore considered this. It struck him as unbearably sad. It struck him as the saddest thing he had ever heard, and he had once watched a Brontosaurus get stuck in a tar pit for six hours while its family stood nearby, unable to help, making sounds that Theodore still heard in his dreams.</p>
<p>“Eat it now,” Theodore said.</p>
<p>“It’s not tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Margaret. Eat the fern.”</p>
<p>Margaret looked at the fern. She looked at the sky, which was now definitely, undeniably, the color of ending. She walked over to the fern—slowly, because she did everything slowly, because she was a Triceratops and that was her way—and she began to eat it.</p>
<p>“How is it?” Theodore asked.</p>
<p>“It’s a fern,” Margaret said, chewing. “It tastes like a fern.”</p>
<p>“But is it a good fern?”</p>
<p>Margaret considered this with the seriousness it deserved.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said finally. “It’s a good fern.”</p>
<p>The sky made its final decision then, and the light changed in a way that light had never changed before, and Theodore realized that he had been wrong about one thing: this was not the end of everything. It was only the end of them. Everything else—the ferns, the rocks, the rivers, the embarrassed volcanoes—would continue in some form, would become something else, would transform into stories that creatures not yet imagined would tell each other millions of years from now, stories about giants who once walked the earth and ate ferns and had small arms and looked at the sky and thought, ridiculously, presumptuously, that it had made a decision about them specifically.</p>
<p>“Margaret,” Theodore said.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you got to eat your fern.”</p>
<p>The light took them then, and the story ended, and sixty-five million years later a man named Theodore, who had no idea why his parents had given him such an old-fashioned name, looked up at the night sky and felt, for reasons he could not explain, a profound sense of loss for something he had never known.</p>
